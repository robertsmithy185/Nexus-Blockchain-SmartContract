**Build with Ease**
If you have built on Ethereum, you are ready to build on Nexus. It is fully EVM-compatible — meaning you can use all your existing tools and code.

​
**Key Features**
- Use your existing Ethereum development setup.
- Rely on all out-of-the box Ethereum tools (Hardhat, Foundry or Remix).
- Use standard libraries (ethers.js, web3.js or viem).
- Deploy Solidity contracts without modifications.
